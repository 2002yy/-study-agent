"""Versioned failure-state contracts for the Claim Engine (frozen 1A-12A).

Two durable axes stay separate and never merge:

- ``RuntimeFailure.code`` describes what happened during the run (process
  failure truth).
- ``WebLookupRun.stop_reason`` describes why the whole run stopped (terminal
  truth).

The catalogs here are stable, versioned string contracts for **new writers**.
They are deliberately not a closed validation gate for **readers**: legacy and
future unknown values must stay readable (frozen 3A/7A/9A), so deserializers
never validate against these catalogs. Writer-side code uses the ``require_*``
guards; legacy/future readers use no catalog validation at all.
